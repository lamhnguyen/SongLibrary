    - OAuth terminologies
        - Resource owner: end user
        - Client: Application
        - Resource Server: Api
        - Authorization Server: Auth0 (authenticate the Resource Owner & issues Access Tokens)
        - User Agent: Browser or Native app (used by the Resource Owner to interact with the Client)
    - Key decisions:
        - OAuth flow (ways of retrieving an Access Token): Implicit Grant (the app DIRECTLY retrieves an Access Token/SPA)
        - Login/signup implementation: Universal (hosted by Auth0)
        - Storing tokens: Local Storage (for simplicity)
